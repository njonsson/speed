# Speed

Speed is a card game for one player to play against the computer.

## TODO

- [ ] Start a new game
- [ ] Define the deck: standard 50-card deck (no jokers)
- [ ] Deal four piles of cards, face-down: 5, then 1, then 1, then 5
- [ ] Deal two hands, face-down, of 19 cards each (alternating between players)
- [ ] Each player takes the top 5 cards from his hand and looks at them (in secret)
- [ ] “Someone” flips the two middle cards face-up
